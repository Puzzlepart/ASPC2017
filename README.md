This repository contains the Puzzlepart solution for ASPC17.

## Architecture ##
We plan to do the following solution and architecture.

![Architecture idea](Documentation/Architecture.PNG "Architecture idea")

At it's core, we will create a provisioning solution to create customer entities in CRM and customer sites in Office 365, which are interlinked. We will use a central SharePoint list to be used as a data source for the entities.

We will use a web form, mobile-supported power app and the bot framework (gitter/slack/teams) to create customer entities.
