# Puzzlepart Appsters @ the Arctic SharePoint Challenge 2017 #

This repository contains the Puzzlepart solution for ASPC17.

## Objective ##

Our objective is quite dynamic at this point (agile!). Our Endl√∂sung is to onboard citizens onto ships to fight the system. Ships will have their own Office 365 groups with ship members to collaborate. We're focusing on the provisioning part of solution from the start - allowing people to report interest and onboard ships using different means.

## Architecture ##
We plan to do the following solution and architecture.

![Architecture idea](Documentation/Architecture.PNG "Architecture idea")

At it's core, we will create a provisioning solution to create user and ship entities in CRM and ship sites in Office 365, which are interlinked. We will use a central SharePoint list to be used as a data source for the entities.

We will use a web form, mobile-supported power app and the bot framework (gitter/slack/teams) to create ships.
